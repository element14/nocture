        To start the application you must first move into the directory containing the
        MIPN CDR Graph Demo Application (as per the install guide).

        Then execute the run.sh shell script by typing the following command:

        <para>
            <programlisting> ./run.sh </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
        The application will then display the following window:

        <para>
            If this is not the first time that the application has been executed it will
            try to connect to the IPNode that it had discovered the last time it was executed.
            If this connection fails, then it will fall into multicast discovery mode.
        </para>
        <para>
            If this is the first time that the application has been executed (or it has
            not found a node on previous executions) the application will enter multicast discovery mode.

        <para>
        In this mode the application joins a multicast group (specified in the settings dialog window) and
        listens for an <emphasis>IPNode discovery</emphasis> message.
        It will also periodically send out a <emphasis>I am looking for IPNodes</emphasis> message.

        <para>
        Once the application has received an <emphasis>IPNode discovery</emphasis> message it will parse
        the message to retrieve the ip address and port that will be used for subscription connections.
