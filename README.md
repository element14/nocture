Project Nocturne
=================

Want to Make a Difference? Here’s How:
--------------------------------------

* Everyday, thousands of vulnerable people are at risk due to incidents in their own homes not being detected in time. Can you use your engineering skills to create a technology-based solution?
* You’ll be using wireless sensors embedded in a mattress pad to monitor if someone is in or out of bed which may indicate a problem. These sensors will then communicate to a smartphone app to let a caregiver know what’s going on.
